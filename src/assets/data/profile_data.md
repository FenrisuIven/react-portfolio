Hey! I am a 3rd year Software Engeneering student at Bohdan Khmelnitsky National University of Cherkasy. I started off learning **C#** as my main language, but as the time went - I grew to like web-development and working with **JavaScript** in itself more than **C#** and desktop development in generall.

As of now, I would say that I am somewhat experienced in development with **JS** and **TS**. I am currently learning and practicing with **Node.js**, with it currently being my main focus, and starting to learn **React**. (expereince)

Generally speaking, I enjoy what mostly everyone likes - playing videogames, watching movies, having a good time in generall. I also love cats and can most confidently consider myself to be a cat person.

Among other things though, I would count my main hobby to be drawing - I have been drawing since early 2019 and haven't really stopped since and don't really plan on stopping any time soon. I really like depicting nature as I see it, trying to capture all of the colors that it has, how sometimes weird they are and how extremelly well they work with each other no matter what.
