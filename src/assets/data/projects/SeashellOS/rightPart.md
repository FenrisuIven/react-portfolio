## [Seashell OS](https://github.com/FenrisuIven/sea-shell-os)

> pure C on top of provided x86 kernel

A bit of a random project, but I still wanted to put it out here. It's a **primitive text-based shell**, code-named _Seashell_, that was developed in _"Operatin Systems"_ course in my university.

The shell in question was built on top of **provided x86 shell**, that had basic kernel loading and keyboard interruptions handling set up. The task was to develop a basic OS that can **output a desired picture**, and then expand it to a primitive shell that can handle **basic CRUD operations** with files.

While it generally has almost to nothing to do with web-development, and is generally not as good in terms of the amount of finished features, I wanted to put it out mostly because I really enjoyed the development process. It was really refreshing to work with something other than _C#_ and _JS_ for a moment, something so low-level that you'll have to define what a _string_ is in your OS, if you can call it that.

The development had started on **Septembet 25th, 2024** and is currently finished, with the latest important update being on _October 20th, 2024_. No further development is planned, since all of the required _CRUD operations_, as well as a **random screensaver**, is currently present and are in a working state.
