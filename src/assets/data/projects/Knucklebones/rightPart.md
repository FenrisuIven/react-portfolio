## [Knucklebones Recreation](https://github.com/FenrisuIven/lamb-knucklebones)

> pure vanilla JS, runs with Vite.js

It's a **Knucklebones game** reacreation from _Cult of The Lamb_ that currently is a heavy WIP, and is basically on top of the list of "the ones I put most of the time into".

The project is created with **vanilla JS** and was aimed mainly on practice in implementation of **OOP principles**. The main focus was on implementation of _score calculations_ and score system in general, so there are no logic for handling visual dice-position manipulations present.

As of now, the best course of actions would be to keep the base score calculation and system, _but to rewrite the UI with React_. This would allow for future implementation of more complex logic and removal of the unnecessary big amount of "dummy" objects placed to handle user input.

The development has started on **September 27th, 2024** and is currently somewhat ongoing, with the latest updated being on _January 16th, 2025_. But no work was done on the project since than, so it can be counted as if it is currently on a hiatus.

Though, further development _is_ planned. Generally speaking, I would want to add an "accounts system", with the ability to create an account, add friends and create rooms to play with them in. I would also like to try and add an AI to play against, but as of now it's not among my top priorities for this project.
