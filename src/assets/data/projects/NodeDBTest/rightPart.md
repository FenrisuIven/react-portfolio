## [Node.js with DB tests](https://github.com/FenrisuIven/node-db-test)

> Node.js, with Express and PG

This is not as much of a project - just a bunch of testing and practice that was done while I was trying to learn **Node.js** on my own and how it can be used with **PostgreSQL**.

The main focus was on trying to understand how exactly is _Node.js_ being used for backend development, what it can do and, well, generally trying to understand how the environment works. The main idea behind the project was to implement **basic CRUD operations** for working with a database.

This would involve working with both the requests from client side and the queries for the chosen **PostgreSQL**. In the mean time, I also took the opportunity to play around with **Express.js** and PostgreSQL library for Node.js **PG**.

The development had started on **January 15th, 2025**, but given the small amount of time I had back at the time, it was quickly finished only a week later on **January 23rd, 2025**. Not as much work had been done in that time, only the primitive add, get and delete "user" functions are present.

No further development is planned for the idea, and a more representative and generally better example of my work with **Node.js** plus **Express.js** is currently in the works while I am undergoing apprenticeship.
